1st Intro:

My Self..., I have around XX years of experience in front end development, As a React Developer, my day typically starts with daily stand-ups, where we discuss progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks. I work in an Agile/Scrum environment, actively participating not only in development but also in sprint planning, backlog grooming, and code reviews to ensure quality and alignment across the team.

UI Development

Convert Figma/Adobe XD designs into pixel-perfect, reusable React components using React 18/19, Next.js, and Tailwind/MUI. Follow Atomic Design principles to build modular components that are responsive and accessible (WCAG standards).Example: Built a dynamic form builder where fields and validations were fully driven by backend configuration.

State Management

Use Redux Toolkit (slices, thunks, RTK Query) for global state management.Implement React Query for caching, pagination, synchronization, and optimistic updates.
Example: Developed an e-commerce cart module handling add/remove/update actions with persisted state (localStorage), while syncing changes with backend via RTK Query.

🌐 API Integration

Integrate with REST APIs and GraphQL (queries/mutations) using Axios, Apollo, or fetch.Implement error handling, retry logic, and authentication flows (JWT + refresh tokens).
Create custom hooks (e.g., useFetchWithRetry) to standardize and reuse API logic across the app.

🚀 Performance Optimization

Profile apps using React Profiler and Lighthouse to identify bottlenecks.Apply code splitting (React.lazy/Suspense), tree-shaking, and dynamic imports to optimize bundle size.
Use useMemo, useCallback, React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Example: Optimized a 10K+ product listing page with virtualization (React Window), improving load time by 40%.

✅ Testing & Quality

Practice TDD/BDD where possible.
Write unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library (mocking APIs, testing hooks/components). Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress/Playwright to validate workflows (e.g., checkout flow with multiple user roles).
Integrate automated tests into CI pipelines, ensuring builds fail if coverage drops. Example: Boosted test coverage of a customer dashboard module to 85% with automated regression tests.

⚙️ CI/CD & Deployment

Work with GitHub/GitLab for version control and raise PRs with code reviews. Ensure compliance with SonarQube, linting, and formatting checks before merge.
Configure Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions pipelines for automated builds, test runs, and deployments. Apply blue-green deployments and feature toggles for controlled releases.
Example: Deployed a Next.js app on Vercel with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for SEO and performance.

🤝 Collaboration & Ownership

Collaborate with UI/UX designers during design reviews and with backend developers to finalize API contracts. Partner with QA testers to prepare test cases, resolve bugs, and ensure smooth UAT.
Provide production support by monitoring logs via Sentry/Kibana, delivering quick hotfixes when required.

👉 Overall, I take end-to-end ownership of features — from requirement analysis to development, testing, deployment, and production support — ensuring not only functionality, but also performance, accessibility, and maintainability.


2nd intro

I am a React Front-End Developer with around 4–5 years of experience.

My core expertise is in React.js with TypeScript, building scalable and maintainable web applications.

Along with development, I also have hands-on experience in Playwright automation testing, which helps me deliver stable and high-quality features.

React Experience (What & Why)

I mainly work with functional components and hooks, following modern React standards.

I focus on:

Building reusable UI components

Keeping components clean, readable, and testable

I follow component-driven development, so UI logic, API logic, and state are well separated.

It improves maintainability.

New developers can understand and extend features easily.

Reduces bugs during enhancements.

TypeScript Usage

I use TypeScript across the project to:

Define clear data contracts between UI and backend

Avoid runtime errors

Improve developer confidence while refactoring

TypeScript helps especially in large applications where multiple developers work on the same codebase.

Real impact

Fewer production issues.

Faster code reviews.

Better collaboration across teams.

State Management & Performance

Based on project size, I choose:

Context API for small to medium apps

Redux Toolkit for complex global state

I actively work on performance optimization, such as:

Reducing unnecessary re-renders

Optimizing component structure

Splitting large components into smaller ones

API Integration

I have experience integrating REST and GraphQL APIs.

I ensure:

Proper loading and error handling

Clean separation between UI and API layers

I also collaborate closely with backend teams to align API contracts.

Playwright Automation (High Level)

I use Playwright for end-to-end automation testing.

I automate critical user flows, not everything blindly.

Common scenarios I cover:

Login and authentication

Form submissions

Navigation and role-based access

I follow Page Object Model, so test cases are reusable and easy to maintain.

Why Playwright

Fast and reliable

Works well across browsers

Good for CI/CD integration

Development + Testing Mindset

Having both development and automation experience helps me:

Think from a user perspective

Write more testable UI code

Catch issues early in the development cycle

This reduces dependency on manual testing and improves release confidence.

Team & Process

I have worked in Agile teams with sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives.

I regularly participate in:

Code reviews

Debugging production issues

Performance improvements

I communicate clearly with QA, backend, and product teams.
